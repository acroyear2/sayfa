# sayfa [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tetsuo/sayfa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tetsuo/sayfa)

a minimal router that plays well with [mengene](https://github.com/tetsuo/mengene).

##Â api

### sayfa(path, fn, [, fn...])

`path` should be in form /foo

You can pass an arbitrary number of `fn`s. They will be run in the [ware](https://github.com/segmentio/ware) context. So `fn` can be a synchronous, asynchronous, or a generator function. See [ware](https://github.com/segmentio/ware).

Example:

```js
sayfa('/foo',
  function (ctx, next) {
    // ...
  },
  function (ctx) {
    // ...
  })
```

Passed `ctx` object holds `name`, `hash`, a unique `cid` and a `query` object if query string is valid against the given schema.

### sayfa.start(opts)

Currently only option is `schema`, which should be in the following form:

Example:

```js
var schema = {
  foo: {
    bar: 'int',
    baz: 'alpha_array'
  }
};
```

See [validate](https://github.com/tetsuo/validate) for allowed types.

Given this schema `#/foo?b=1&ba=beep&ba=boop` will be deserialized to `{ bar: 1, baz: ['beep', 'boop']}`.

## Status

I haven't tested `sayfa` on any production yet. This was just an idea that came up while talking with a colleague; all contributions are welcomed :)

API is pretty much inspired by [page.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js), so if you are looking for a more robust alternative, I suggest you to go with it.
